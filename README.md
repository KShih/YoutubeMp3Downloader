# How to use this app
You have two ways to download mp3 from Youtube by this app

## First way
1. search the youtube vedio that you want to download
2. click into that vedio
3. press "下載" to Download

2. open the app without click any vedio
3. press "下載" to Download the vedio you just copy

# However....
There is still a bug there in my project, sometimes you will successfully download the vedio not in the correct format( .bin or .html ).
This problem happened randomly, which means sometimes you will download the correct format(.mp3), and sometimes not, although it is the same vedio.

# So
If you have any idea, feel free to fork my project.
